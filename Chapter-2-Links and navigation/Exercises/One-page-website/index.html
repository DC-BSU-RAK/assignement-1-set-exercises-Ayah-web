        <h1> Terarria </h1>
        <p>
            Terraria is a 2D adventure game where you can explore, build, and fight in a randomly created world ranging from normal to large.<br>
            Think of it this way, Minecraft meets 2D gaming! Dig underground to find treasure (sometimes guided by fairies),<br>
            craft cool weapons and tools, and take on big bosses like the Eye of Cthulhu. Build your own base, meet fun characters,<br>
            and survive crazy events like goblin invasions. With millions of items to collect and secrets to discover, Terraria<br>
            is absolutely packed with fun. Whether you like building, fighting, or exploring, this game will definitely be up your ally!
