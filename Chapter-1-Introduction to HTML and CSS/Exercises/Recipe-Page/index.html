        Imagine falling inlove with a recipe of creamy and strawberry goodness... <br>
        Well, look no further as you stumble across my favorite recipe of a yummy <br>
        strawberry cheesecake recipe! This recipe entails a velvety and dreamy cheese-<br>
        cake that's as smooth as a cloud, with a sweet-tangy strawberry swirl that dances <br>
        through every bite. What about the crust you may ask? It's a buttery, crumbly <br>
        nom-nom worthy hug made from beloved graham crackers, holding everything together <br>
        like a cozy blanket. To top it all off, is a gorgeous glistening strawberry topping <br>

        with the graham cracker crumbs until it resembles wet sand. </li>
        <li>  Press the mixture firmly into the bottom <br>
        of a springform pan (9-inch works well). Use the <br>
        back of a spoon or a glass to make it even and compact. </li>
