        Strawberry Cheesecake recipe  
    </h1>

    <p>
        Imagine falling inlove with a recipe of creamy and strawberry goodness... <br>
        Well, look no further as you stumble across my favorite recipe of a yummy <br>
        strawberry cheesecake recipe! This recipe entails a velvety and dreamy cheese-<br>
        cake that's as smooth as a cloud, with a sweet-tangy strawberry swirl that dances <br>
        through every bite. What about the crust you may ask? It's a buttery, crumbly <br>
        nom-nom worthy hug made from beloved graham crackers, holding everything together <br>
        like a cozy blanket. To top it all off, is a gorgeous glistening strawberry topping <br>
        that hooks you in for the most perfect mouthful!

        P.s , you might want to hide this after making, otherwise you'll be left with crumbs
        and an empty tummy !
